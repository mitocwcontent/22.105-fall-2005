Course Meeting Times
--------------------

2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Description
-----------

This course discusses principles and applications of electromagnetism, starting from Maxwell's equations, with emphasis on phenomena important to nuclear engineering and radiation sciences, solution methods for electrostatic and magnetostatic fields, charged particle motion in those fields, particle acceleration and focusing and collisions with charged particles and atoms. It also covers electromagnetic waves, wave emission by accelerated particles, Bremsstrahlung, Compton scattering, photoionization, and elementary applications to ranging, shielding, imaging, and radiation effects.

Textbooks
---------

### Class Textbook

Jackson, J. D. _Classical Electrodynamics_. 3rd ed. New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons, 1998. ISBN: 9780471309321.  
A great book. The first half of the book now uses SI units. The second half still uses CGS units. This book will serve as a valuable reference for many years to come. I still use my original copy, purchased in 1962!

### Supplemental Readings

Feynman, R. P. _The Feynman Lectures on Physics_. Vol. 1. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1971. ISBN: 9780201021165.

Panofsky, W. K., and M. Philips. _Classical Electricity and Magnetism_. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1962. ISBN: 9780201057027.

Evans, R. D. _The Atomic Nucleus_. Malabar, FL: Kreiger Publishing, 1982. ISBN: 9780898744149. (Reprint of 1955 McGraw-Hill edition).  
Chapters 18-24 contain an extensive discussion of charged particle interaction with matter, energy loss, ranging, etc.

Humphries, S. [_Principles of Charged Particle Accelerators_](http://www.fieldp.com/cpa/cpa.html). New York, NY: J. Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1986. ISBN: 9780471878780.  
Has relevant material on ion focusing and optics.

Livingstone, M. S., and J. P. Blewett. _Particle Accelerators._ New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 1962. ISBN: 1114443840.  
Has a very practical discussion of many types of accelerators still useful in medium energy applications.

Herzberg, G. _Atomic Spectra and Atomic Structure._ Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, 1944. ISBN: 9780486601151.  
Good introduction to atomic spectra which is a small part of this subject.

Problem Sets
------------

The weekly problem sets are an essential part of the course. Working through these problems is crucial to understanding the material.

Problem sets will generally be assigned at the Tuesday lecture and will be due at start of class on the following Thursday.

Exams
-----

There will be a midterm exam and a final exam. If you did well on the problem sets you should do well on the midterm and final exams.

Grading
-------

The final grade for the course will be based on the following:
